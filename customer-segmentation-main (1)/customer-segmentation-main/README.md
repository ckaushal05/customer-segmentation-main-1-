# This is my customer segmentation project
- Reading the file using pandas
- checking the columns data types using describe function
- checking for null values
- checking for duplicate records and drop the duplicated values

### Univariate analysis
- perform the univariate analysis i.e. how the each feature is distributed
- if any value treaten as null value replace it with mode of perticular feature

### Outlier detection
- Detect the outliers in categorical columns using box plot
- impute te IQR values
- replace the outliers with IQR values

### Bivariate analysis
- Bivariate analysis is knowing how feature is distrubuted with respect totarget variable

### Encoding
- Transforming categorical features into numerical values

### Feature selection
- checking for the features for correlated or not by setting threshold value

### splitting the data
- splitting the data into train data and test data

### Balencing the data
- Here the data is imbalenced balencing the train data using oversampling technique called SMOTTEN

### standerdization
- Transforming train data from range of numerical values into  between 0 to 

### Model building
- Building the model and train with different parameters and find the best parameters using gridserchCV
- check the performance parameters and check the model accuracy using AURROC metric
- find the best model with high accuracy and high AOUROC value
